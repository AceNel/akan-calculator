  <h1>Akan Names Birthday Calculator</h1>
  <p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Welcome to Akan Birthday Calculator.
    Most people do know when their birthdays are,
    but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us,
    there is a way to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.</p>
  <p style="font-family:sans-serif">
    The Akans name Calculator takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender
    outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
    Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
